                    my
                    free
                    time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new technologies.</p>

                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>I'm Aisosa, a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience in building
                        scalable
                        web applications.
                        My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how things work under the hood, which led me
                        to
                        pursue computer
                        science. Today, I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks and cloud technologies, always
                        eager to
                        learn and adapt to
                        new challenges.</p>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i>
                <div>
                    <h3>Goals in This Program</h3>
                    <p>My primary goal is to become a technical leader who not only writes excellent code but also
                        mentors
                        the next generation
                        of developers. I aim to contribute to open-source projects that make a meaningful impact, launch
                        my
                        own SaaS product
                        within the next two years, and continuously expand my knowledge in AI and machine learning
                        integration.</p>

                    <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
                    <p>Remember that every expert was once a beginner. The imposter syndrome you sometimes feel is
                        normal and a sign that
                        you're pushing yourself to grow. Keep being curious, stay humble, and never stop learning. The
                        challenges you face today
                        are building the resilience you'll need tomorrow. Trust the process and enjoy the journey.</p>

                    <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I believe in work-life balance and maintaining hobbies that keep me creative. I'm
                        an avid coffee
                        enthusiast, enjoy hiking on weekends, and recently started learning to play the guitar. These
                        activities help me stay
                        fresh and often provide unexpected insights for solving technical problems.</p>
